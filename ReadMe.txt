NOTE: 	1. Joint Account has not been implemented.
	2. Transaction Db file only stores the last transaction done by a user and not all the transactions done by one or any other user.

========================================	SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT 		=============================================

1. Change the type from Boolean to integer and 0 for admin 1 for normal customer 2 for joint account
2. Change the customer structure and add another user username and they both should be unique.
3. Login as of now could be done by the primary user later change it to by any user.
4. Transaction db to hold all the transactions done by the all the users.
5. Changes to be made in the admin account.
6. Consecutively changes to be made in normal and joint users
7. Users in joint account should be unique. That is we use for searching in the db.
